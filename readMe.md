### Why Did I Choose to Code Instead of Joining Computer Science, Computer Engineering, or Information Technology?

Despite having a basic understanding of programming and limited experience (pretty humble XD), opportunities can be scarce when you join ComSci, IT, or CPE. You face more competition in the market and in how you sell yourself.

ECE is like a gateway where you just need to put your brain to work, and opportunities will come to you automatically.

If I acquire my ECE, it would be pretty impressive because who wouldn‚Äôt want an electronics expert and programmer on their side? Plus, when you're out of money, you can still find a job due to your diverse skills, etc.
